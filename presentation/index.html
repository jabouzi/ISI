                        This window provides also, a variety of preset projects you can choose from to set up the foundation of your app. Each choice provides your starter project with different code
                        and resources generated by Android Studio. The Empty Activity is already selected for you by Android Studio, which is exactly what you want. Don’t worry about what an Activity is 
                        right now; all will be revealed soon. Go to the bottom of the window and press the Next button.</p>

                        Android Studio is a large and complex piece of software and, if you dive in without a
                        good map, you may find yourself lost!
                        Before you start to build you app, take a look at what Android Studio has to offer as part

                        <p>1. The right window is the Editor.
                        This window provides you with space to edit your app’s source code. It provides
                        syntax highlighting, auto completion for methods and objects as well as the ability
                        to drop breakpoints into your code while debugging. You’ll learn more about
                        breakpoints and debugging in "Chapter 4: Debugging." You’ll spend most of your
                        development time using the Editor to code your app to work exactly the way you
                        intend.
                        <br />
                        2. The left window is the Project
                        navigator, to the left of the Editor.
                        This window shows you everything your project contains; from code to image
                        assets, you can find it here. Android Studio already provides you with a lot to begin
                        with. You can see this by left-clicking on the arrow to the left of the items in the
                        Project navigator.
                        Don’t worry about these files for now. You’ll become well-acquainted with them in
                        the chapters to come.</p>

                        want to run your app. But before you can run your app, you need a device — real or
                        virtual — on which to run it! Take a look at the button highlighted.</p>

                        need to get your device up for use with Android Studio. The first thing to do is to
                        connect your Android device to your machine via a USB cable.<br/><br/>
                        Note: If you’re using a Windows machine, you’ll need to download a USB driver
                        for your device first. You can download the driver and find instructions on

                        <p>Granting USB debugging privileges is a potential security hole, so most devices have
                        this turned off by default. Since you will need to install apps over USB as a developer,
                        you need to turn this on.
                        When you are ready, tap OK and the USB Debugging toggle will enable. Your device is now set up for development!</p>

                        Layouts are incredibly flexible and let you define
                        how your user interface is presented on the device to the user.
                        You can create layouts in one of two ways:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Using an XML file that lets you declare your user interface ahead of time.</li>
                        <li>Writing Java code to programmatically create your layout when your app runs.</li>
                        </ul><br />
                        <p style="text-align: left">You will define your layouts in XML. This is because Android Studio has a
                        powerful Layout editor that covers 90% of the cases you’ll ever need when creating a
                        user interface.</p>

                        The design tab displays the Visual Editor! In design mode, the middle of Android Studio will show a
                        few different screens.<br>
                        The first screen of interest is the preview area in the middle, next to what looks like a
                        blueprint. This is where you’ll begin to build your user interface.
                        <br/> In the top left of the middle section of Android Studio, you’ll see the Palette.This contains all the built-in user interface components you can use to build the
                        screens of your Android app.
                        What’s even more useful is that you can drag and drop from this palette straight into
                        the preview screen to add a component. Finally at the bottom it's the Component Tree where you have the layout hierarchy</p>

                        you like — but using the Design tab is much more visual.</p>

                        The ConstraintLayout is a powerful new class. It allows you to lay out child views using "<b>constraints</b>" to define position based relationships between different views found in your layout.
                        The aim of the ConstraintLayout is to help reduce the number of nested views, which will improve the performance of your layout files. The layout class also makes it 
                        easier for you to define layouts than when using a RelativeLayout as you can now anchor any side of a view with any side of another, rather than having to place a whole view 
                        to any side of another.</p>

                        <p style="text-align: left;">Android apps are exactly the same — they’re built around a set of screens that have a
                        specific purpose. Each screen you see in an app is known as an <b>Activity</b>. An Activity is
                        built around a single task that you want your user to perform.
                        For instance, in most apps you have a settings screen to adjust the settings of the app.
                        There is a sign-in screen where you login using your username and password, and many
                        other screens that have specific purposes.
                        From now you’ll begin putting together an Activity and you’ll finally get to lay down some code!</p>

                        <p style="text-align: left;">All apps have bugs at some point in their lifetime. Some will be subtle, such as oddities
                        within the UI, while others will be obvious, such as outright crashes. As a developer, you
                        need to avoid bugs in your app at all costs to make sure your users are happy as can be.
                        Android and Android Studio provide developers with a number of tools to help you
                        track down and fix bugs with relative ease.

                        <p style="text-align: left;">Having an app that looks visually appealing and can surprise the user in gentle ways is
                                one that will stick out when compared to similar apps. While it’s not integral to the
                                functionality of your app, it shows that you care about your app and gives its own look.

                    <section>
                        <p style="text-align: left;">Animations give visual emphasis to elements and help you direct the user’s
                            attention. When it comes to animation, the most important rule is to use it where and
                            when it matters — not simply because you can.
